# Mini Project 1 Execution Instructions
### Ian Zhang

1. Make sure you have all the packages installed. Libraries used in the project are as follows:
```
zipfile
sys
os
io
glob
numpy
nltk
shutil
sklearn
matplotlib
```

2. Download the zip file `project1_datasets.zip`. Create a new temp folder where you can put the `project1_datasets.zip` and `project.py` together.

3. Please do not unzip the zip file. you don't need to do anything else after you create the temp folder and put the `project1_datasets.zip` and `project.py` in that folder. The contents in the zip will be automatically extracted. 

3. Run the command `python3 project.py` to execute the program. 

4. It takes around 30-45min for my 2018 Macbook Pro to get the results. Should be faster if you run the program on the server. The results will be saved in `results.txt` that's automatically created by this program. There will also be 6 plots exported automatically to the temp folder as follows:
```
enron1_BagOfWords_ParametersTuning.png
enron1_Bernoulli_ParametersTuning.png
enron2_BagOfWords_ParametersTuning.png
enron2_Bernoulli_ParametersTuning.png
enron4_BagOfWords_ParametersTuning.png
enron4_Bernoulli_ParametersTuning.png
```

5. After you get the results you can safety delete everything. Besides the exported files, there should only be `project1_datasets.zip` and `project.py` in that folder. All other ones are automatically removed.

6. I hope this could be fun for you. Cheers.
